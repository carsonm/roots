  Hey guys...Ginnie here.  What makes me tick you ask? The best way to explain ME to you is like this... when I am photographing peoples memories and moments it brings me joy because it brings me back to my happy memories.  I cry at weddings because I know how that love feels.  I tear up and can’t stop smiling for at least a week after holding a newborn.  I grin from ear to ear as I “peep” in on an engaged couple giving each other those glances that will eventually lead to the rest of their lives together.  My favorite part of it all are the feelings I feel inside, you know, deep down in my core that make me itch for more.  The feelings usually last long enough until my next session.  Uh-oh, did I just admit to an addiction?  My name is Ginnie McMillan and I am addicted to my photography.  :)
